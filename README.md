# Metroid-Dread-Maps

High quality images of each region in Metroid Dread. 

## Features:
- Roughly 4:1 scale (default zoom level in-game, some locations might be slightly off)
- Items have labels and recognizable icons
- Consistent color scheme for easy identification

## Todo at some point:
- Move to SVG (vector drawings) to allow for much better scaling (maybe process map files themselves)
- Create world state maps (i.e. frozen Artaria, escape Hanubia, etc.)
- Find various incorrectly marked doors and hidden pathways

If you see anything inaccurate, either start an issue here or message/ping me on discord (@ih8ih8sn0w#9183). 
Issue template:
1. What region is the issue found in?
2. What is incorrect (i.e. mislabeled item, missing door)
3. Please provide an image of the in-game map (doesn't need to be too high quality, I just need to know where to look)
